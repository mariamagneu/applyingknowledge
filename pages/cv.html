   <h1>Maria Magdalena Neu</h1> 
   <p>Culturally rich professional fluent in German, Brazilian Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Started in Museums & Politics
    but took a wild turn into tech and web3 in 2021. From teaching Yoga and languages to leading Favela Museums workshops, my skills are
   diverse. At Mintbase, I went from a lively Community Manager to a go-getter Partnerships Manager, rocking international
   workshops and mainstage talks. I've pitched the Mintbase toolkit to devs worldwide in countless
   meetings. Recognized for my creativity &boundless energy, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments. Excited about potential collaborations
Let's explore working together. As I am searching in tech, I'll provide more inforamtion about my experience at Mintbase.
