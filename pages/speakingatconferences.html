            At NEARCON 2022 I was interviewed on the Mainstage about why Mintbase is building on NEAR, why Mintbase switched from ETH to NEAR & other fun things.

                This workshop was a general onboarding effort to web3, starting at the basics of what blockchain is, touching points of transparency and decentralization, FTs & NFTs. We helped everyone to hopen their first wallet and made them redeem snacks & beverages (burning the NFT to receive the physical object).

                This workshop encompassed understanding the mintbase toolkit, its interaction with the DAO system on near (AstroDAO) and all the possibilities that open up.

                    Held a workshop to mostly ETH natives about how DAOs can effectively create smart contracts, mint NFTs (with shared royalties and revenue), buy NFTs, list them for sale and do all things a individual wallet can do through the partnership between AstroDAO & Mintbase.
