    <h1>Flexbox, flex-containers, flex items</h1>
    <h2>Don't worry, I know I am bad with aesthetics and color-choices. I am just working my way towards backend things</h2>
<h3> Below you can watch me playing with flexbox and auto margin</h3>
 <div class="parent">
    <div class="elaborate">
        <p class="left">this one on the left side</p>
        <p class="right"> and this one on the right side</p>
    </div>
    <div class="elaborate">
        <p class="left">these ones</p>
        <p class="left">on the left side</p>
        <p class="right"> and this one on the right side</p>   
    </div>
<h3> as you can see I haven't completely mastered the one below yet, the two elements that are supposed to rest on the right side only do so if we minimize the window</h3>
    <div class="elaborate">
        <p class="left">these ones</p>
        <p class="left">on the left side</p>
        <p class="right"> and these ones </p>
        <p class="right">on the right side</p>
    </div>

<h2>With Flexbox you can arrange items into rows or columns and make them grow or shrink ~~flex~~.</p>
<h3>A cool thing about flex-containers is, that you can make the elements adapt to the screen size</p>
<div class="flex-container"> 
    <p>For</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>These</p>
    <p>Paragraph-Elements</p>
</div>
<h2> so if you re-size your browser window you'll see the elements above adapt in size. COOOL</h2>
<p> Why? Because they are inside a flex-container class div element, which i've set the display to flex. And I defined that every P element in that class would be flex:1. And that's it.</p>

<h2> Same for vertically aranged elements</h2>


<div class="columncontainer"> 
    <p>These</p>
    <p>Are</p>
    <p>Stacked</p>
    <p>Now</p>
</div>
<h2> Want to have you mind blown? Every flex item can be a flex container in itself.</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="nested-flex-container"><p>AMA</p><p>ZING</p></div><p>right?</p>
</div>
<div class="threevalues"> 
    <p class="big">Look at</p>
    <p class="small"> these Examples</p>
    <p class="big">are they growing and</p>
    <p class="small">shrinking equally?</p>
 </div>
<h2> Nope, they aren't. Because their flex-growth item value is defined to 0.5 & 2, meaning that they will grow differently.</h2>
<div class="shrinking"> 
    <p> And these?</p>
    <p> What's happening?</p>
    <p class="smallbro">are they growing and</p>
    <p>shrinking equally?</p>
 </div>
<h2> Nope, because the third element has the smallbro class defined which makes it smaller than the other 3.</h2>
