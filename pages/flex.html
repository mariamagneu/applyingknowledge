    <h1>Flexbox, flex-containers, flex items</h1>
    <p>With Flexbox you can arrange items into rows or columns and make them grow or shrink ~~flex~~.</p>
    <p>A cool thing about flex-containers is, that you can make the elements adapt to the screen size</p>

<div class="flex-container"> 
    <p>For</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>These</p>
    <p>Paragraphs</p>
</div>
<h2> so if you re-size your browser window you'll see the elements above adapt in size. COOOL</h2>
<p> Why? Because they are inside a flex-container class div element, which i've set the display to flex. And I defined that every P element in that class would be flex:1. And that's it.</p>
