    <h1>This is my progress tracking website</h1>
    <p> I'll probably add some more information in here as soon as I have an idea what this is supposed to be. While that is not the case, check out who I am <a href="pages/cv.html" class="button-link">here</a>.
<h2>Boxes are important to nail in CSS so I will be training here</h2>
<h3>So if I am able to make this box pink and tall</h3>
<h4>And this one violet and flat</h4>
<h2> I guess I'll have the minimum of understanding. </h2>
<p> I want to have these boxes here several times. Once beside one another. Once below one another. And once overlapping.</p>
    <p> besides eachother: </p>
 <div class = "h-box"> 
    <h3 class="beside">So if I am able to make this box pink and tall</h3>
    <h4 class="beside" ID="flat">And this one violet and flat</h4>
</div>

<p> below one another:</p> 
<div class="v-box">
    <h3 class="below">So if I am able to make this box pink and tall</h3>
    <h4 class="below">And this one violet and flat</h4>
</div>
<p> overlapping </p>
    <div class="o-box"></div>
<h3 class="overlapping">So if I am able to make this box pink and tall</h3>
<h4 class="overlapping2">And this one violet and flat</h4>
</div>
</body>
